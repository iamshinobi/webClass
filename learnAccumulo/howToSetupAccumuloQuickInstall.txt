How to Setup Accumulo Quick Install (for development purposes)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Follow these procedures to setup an Accumulo distribution with hadoop, yarn, HDFS
NOTE:  This should be used for development purposes


Assumptions:
 A) You have a Java JDK 7 or later installed and in the PATH


Procedure  (Do *not* run as root)
----------------------------------
 1. Make sure my local account can ssh to localhost [without prompting for password]
    unix> cd ~
    unix> ssh-keygen -t rsa
          Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hadoop/.ssh/id_rsa):   <press enter>
            
          Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):    <press enter>
          Enter same passphrase again:                   <press enter>

    unix> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    unix> chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

 
 2. Verify that your account can ssh to localhost without prompting for a password
    NOTE:  This ssh command should *not*  ask for password but first time it will prompt for adding RSA to the list of known hosts.
    unix> ssh localhost
       
    The authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 9b:35:ab:51:bc:6e:92:ff:a5:4f:2d:a9:11:d5:36:ae.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?                    yes
 
 
 3. Make sure you do *NOT* have HADOOP environment variables established in your .bashrc


 4. Build the quickinstall
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects
    unix> git clone https://github.com/accumulobook/quickinstall accQuickInstall
    unix> cd accQuickInstall
    unix> mvn clean package
          -- Now, I have ~/intellijProjects/accQuickInstall/target/accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz


5. Setup the quickinstall package
   unix> cd ~
   unix> cp ~/intellijProjects/accQuickInstall/target/accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz  .
   unix> tar zxvf accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz
   unix> rm accumulo-quickinstall-1.6.1.tar.gz
         -- Now, I have ~/quickinstall-home
         

6. Install the package
   unix> cd ~/quickinstall-home
   unix> ./bin/install
   
   RSA key fingerprint is db:94:41:dd:d9:03:c5:67:38:04:87:2c:25:75:53:d6.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?  Yes
  
   You should see this final output:
       Accumulo is now running from /home/adam/quickinstall-home
       You should run
           source /home/adam/quickinstall-home/bin/quickinstall-env
       and get to work.  The root accumulo user password is "secret".
       
       After sourcing the env file, your PATH will be setup.  Source that
       file whenever you want to work with the Accumulo Quickinstall
       
       To stop Accumulo, Zookeeper and Hadoop run
          qi-stop
       
       To start it up again, run
          qi-start
       There will also be a couple of shortcut commands to open the local docs.
       These pages link to local copies of the API docs.  Run
          accumulo-doc
       or
          hadoop-doc
       
       Here are some useful links.
         The Accumulo monitor page should be available at http://localhost:50095
         HDFS should be available at http://localhost:50070
         The Yarn resource manager should be available at http://localhost:8088
       
       You can also reference the README in the quickinstall-home directory for
       more information.
       
       Happy Accumulating


 7. Startup an Accumulo Shell
    unix> source ~/quickinstall-home/bin/quickinstall-env


    unix> accumulo shell -u root -p secret
 
    Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
    - 
    - version: 1.6.1
    - instance name: accumulo
    - instance id: f3acd2f1-7a12-476b-ac58-dc348fcd41af
    - 
    - type 'help' for a list of available commands
    - 
    root@accumulo> 
  

8. Look at the Acumullo Overview website:
   a. Open a browser
   b. Connect to http://localhost:50095/
   
   
9. Enable binding on all IP addresses
   unix> qi-stop
   unix> vi ~/quickinstall-home/accumulo-1.6.1/conf/accumulo-env.sh 
 
     # Should the monitor bind to all network interfaces -- default: false
     export ACCUMULO_MONITOR_BIND_ALL="true"
     
    unix> qi-start
